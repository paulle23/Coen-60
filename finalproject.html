		<h3>What is Phantom Limb Pain?</h3>
		<p class="info">Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a type of chronic pain that follows limb amputation, brachial plexus avulsion injury, or spinal cord injury. It is the pain that is felt in the area where a limb has been amputated. Although it is gone, the nerve endings at the site of the amputation continue to send pain signals to the brain that make the brain think the limb is still there.<br>Some of the pain that people experience are tingling, cramping, heat, cold, pain, and squeezing. There have been reports of amputees feeling sensation in the "phantom limb" that might have been experienced before the limb was removed. With the actual limb, there may be residual limb pain, also known as "stump pain" at the location of the amputation, in addition to cramping, burning, aching, or sensations of heat or cold.</p>

		<h3>What Forms of Treatment are there?</h3>
		<p class="info2">Treatment is usually based on the amount of pain felt. These include applying heat, massaging the area of amputation, and biofeedback to reduce muscle tension. Other treatments are acupuncture, medicines, and surgery to remove scar tissue entangling a nerve. Usually, the most effective approach is through combining multiple treatments.<br>Some other treatments are transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, also known as TENS, of the limb, or physical therapy and artificial limbs. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is the use of low voltage electrical currents to treat pain and involves a small device to deliver current close to the nerves. As of today, there is no concrete explanation as to why TENS works. The first theory is that the current stimulates nerve cells that block the transmission of pain signals, modifying your perception of pain,The other theory is that nerve stimulation raises the level of endorphins which block the perception of pain.<br>Mirror therapy is another popular form of treatment. This involves using a mirror so that the reflection of your intact limb looks like your missing limb, which you then look at. When you move your intact limb, you see movement in the phantom limb without pain.<br>As a last resort, electrical stimulation of the spine may be attempted to relieve chronic phantom limb pain, though results have been mixed. This involves pulses of electricity that are sent down the spine to mimic the signals the brain normally sends to initiate movement and are delivered through a stimulator that is surgically placed on the spinal cord.</p>
