		<h4>Design</h4><p>
		The concept of the VR treatment was based upon mirror therapy research. Patients using mirror therapy perform simple exercises such as clenching the fist from their intact arm to create the appearance of motion in their missing limb. Extending mirror therapy with the use of VR technology involved the development of VR environments where the patient would experience their limbs as intact through the appearance and movement of their VR avatar. Oxford created VR environments for both upper and lower body amputee populations, with the aim of making them immersive and engaging.
		<br>
		<br>
		They developed three distinct VR environments involving the use of a basic bicycle pedaler while wearing the VR headset and a single motion sensor (developed by the VR contractor) attached to the pedal containing the participantâ€™s prosthesis. This combination allowed the participant to bicycle on the pedaler at their preferred pace in the VR environment of their choice while wearing the VR headset, with the motion sensor calibrating the pace of the VR avatar to that of the participant. In this environment patients would be able to interact with their VR limbs and potentially alleviate any pain or discomfort they might have.</p>
