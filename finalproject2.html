		<h3>Design Description</h3>
		<p class="info2">Successful treatment of phantom limb pain can be difficult as it is usually based on the amount of pain felt. These include applying heat, massaging the area of amputation, and biofeedback to reduce muscle tension. Other treatments are acupuncture, medicines, and surgery to remove scar tissue entangling a nerve. Usually, the most effective approach for treatment is through combining multiple treamtments.<br>Some other treatments are transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, also known as TENS, of the limb, or physical therapy and artificial limbs. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is the use of low voltage electrical currents to treat pain and involves a small device to deliver current close to the nerves. As of today, there is no concrete explanation as to why TENS works. The first theory is that the current stimulates nerve cells that block the transmission of pain signals, modifying your perception of pain,The other theory is that nerve stimulation raises the level of endorphins which block the perception of pain.<br>Mirror therapy is another popular form of treatment. This involves using a mirror so that the reflection of your intact limb looks like your missing limb, which you then look at. When you move your intact limb, you see movement in the phantom limb without pain.<br>As a last resort, electrical stimulation of the spine may be attempted to relieve chronic phantom limb pain, though results have been mixed. This involves pulses of electricity that are sent down the spine to mimic the signals the brain normally sends to initiate movement and are delivered through a stimulator that is surgically placed on the spinal cord.</p>
